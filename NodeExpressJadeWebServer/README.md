Node + Express + Jade + MongoDB test.
===================================

Since this seems a fairly common stack in the industry today I decided to test a bit the waters and give it a go before deciding to eventually use these technologies in a project of mine.

This application really doesn't do anything useful per-se but serves mainly as a reference design. Some parts might seem over-commented as I use this also as a note book where to keep relevant info for furure reference.
