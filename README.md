Playground
==========

In this repository I collect all those smaller projects that I don't expect will be of any practical interest aside from being an educational reference. These projects are complete and functioning but are not real products, and they are not meant to be.

Projects
===========

Chrono
------

This is my first attemprt at VHDL code, I modeled here a simple chronometer with minutes and seconds. The architecture is modeled after usual logical components, such as BCD counters and decoders. Display is on 4 sever segments displays.

WebAppSample
------

This is a skeleton web application that demonstrates how to build an application that runs fully on the client side and doesn't rely on network connection. The user can interact with the application in his browser (single page application) and his actions are synced to the server in background. Application status is also fullly preserved should the browser be closed or should the user navigate to another page. Makes use of HTML5 browser local storage and background workers.
