WEB App Sample
=============

This is a skeleton web application that demonstrates how to build an application that runs fully on the client side and doesn't rely on network connection. The user can interact with the application in his browser (single page application) and his actions are synced to the server in background. Application status is also fullly preserved should the browser be closed or should the user navigate to another page. Makes use of HTML5 browser local storage and background workers.
